# dice-game
Welcome guys this is a pig game created by me--using all the front-end elements;

How the game basically works:
There are 2 players , At start player 1 rolls the dice and the current score of player 1 is updated until the dice is rolled as 1.If the dice is rolled as 1 the current score sets to zero. So the player has to take the risk and roll the dice.If he is not sure that he can increase the score, then he can hold thhe score which sets his current score to the player 1's score and the chance is sent to the next player(2) and the loop continues until the player score of any one of the player reaches 100. Then the player wins and the game ends;

the output display is created usinf html, css and the logic for the game is implemented using javascript;
